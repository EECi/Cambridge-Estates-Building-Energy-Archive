# Cambridge University Estates building electricity usage 2010-2019

This repository hosts a series of datasets of historic building electricity usage from buildings across the Cambridge University Estates, found in the `datasets` directory. These datasets are formatted to be compatiable with the CityLearn [[1]](#1) environment for building energy control simulation. Detail on this formatting can be found in the [CityLearn documentation](https://www.citylearn.net/overview/dataset.html).

The following sections provide information on the source of the data variables within the datasets, and any pre-processing performed.

## Building Electrical Demand

## Outdoor Weather Variables

## Solar Weather Variables

## Electricity Pricing

## Grid Carbon intensity
